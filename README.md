This is a User Management System project built with Django and React.

## Description

The User Management System is a web application that allows you to manage user records. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for user data.

The project consists of two main components:

1. Backend (Django): Handles the server-side logic, database management, and REST API endpoints.
2. Frontend (React): Provides the user interface for interacting with the system.

## Features

- User creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
- Integration with Django REST Framework for building the API.
- React frontend for an interactive user interface.
- Redux for state management in the frontend.
- Axios for making HTTP requests from the frontend.
- React Router for handling routing in the frontend.
